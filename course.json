In this module, we will introduce the fundamental concepts of databases, including what they are, how they work, and why they are essential.</p>\n<h2>What is a Database?</h2>\n<p>A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. It can be as simple as a list of names and addresses or as complex as a system that powers an entire organization&#39;s operations. Databases allow us to store, retrieve, and manipulate data efficiently and securely.</p>\n<h2>Components of a Database System</h2>\n<p>There are several components of a database system. These include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Data - the information that is being stored</li>\n<li>Hardware - the physical equipment used to store and access the data</li>\n<li>Software - the programs used to manage and manipulate the data</li>\n<li>Users - the people who interact with the data and the system</li>\n<li>Procedures - the rules and guidelines for using the system</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Types of Databases</h2>\n<p>There are various types of databases, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Some common database types include:</p>\n<h3>Relational Databases</h3>\n<p>Relational databases are based on the relational model, which uses tables to organize data. Each table has rows (also called records) and columns (also called fields) that define the data&#39;s structure. Relational databases are widely used and are ideal for applications that require complex queries and transactions.</p>\n<h3>Object-Oriented Databases</h3>\n<p>Object-oriented databases (OODBs) use objects to represent data. Objects have attributes (similar to fields in a table) and methods (functions that operate on the object&#39;s data). OODBs are useful for applications that require complex data structures and relationships between objects.</p>\n<h3>NoSQL Databases</h3>\n<p>NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that do not use tables to organize data. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media posts or sensor data. NoSQL databases are highly scalable and can handle large amounts of data efficiently.</p>\n<h2>Database Management Systems</h2>\n<p>A database management system (DBMS) is software that manages a database. It provides tools for creating, modifying, and querying the database. Some popular DBMSs include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Oracle Database</li>\n<li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>\n<li>MySQL</li>\n<li>SQLite</li>\n<li>MongoDB</li>\n</ol>","order":1,"type":"html"}},"slug":"intro","name":"Introduction to Databases","short":"Intro"},"module3":{"order":3,"name":"NoSQL Databases","slug":"nosql","blocks":{"pKxyNGSTot":{"type":"html","html":"<p>NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that do not use tables to store and organize data.

Some common use cases include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Real-time data processing - NoSQL databases can handle large amounts of streaming data in real-time.</li>\n<li>Social media - NoSQL databases can efficiently store and retrieve social media posts and interactions.</li>\n<li>Internet of Things (IoT) - NoSQL databases can handle the massive amounts of sensor data generated by IoT devices.</li>\n<li>Content management - NoSQL databases are useful for storing and retrieving unstructured content such as multimedia files.</li>\n</ol>","order":1},"DJ4bHWjgBj":{"title":"Conclusion - NoSQL Databases","type":"highlight","order":2,"content":"NoSQL databases are a powerful tool for storing and organizing large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.
